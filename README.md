# Cheetah Game Engine

Hey and welcome to the Cheetah game engine. This is currently an individually developed engine project which will generally follow the structure of the Hazel engine developed in the YouTube tutorial by The Cherno. This YouTube series can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrATfBNZ98dC-V-N3m0Go4deliWHPFwT).

The chosen language is the Rust Programming Language, due to its speed and type safety benefits. Currently, I am a bit of a Rust novice, and so this project is also an opportunity to learn the language. Finally, this project is simply an opportunity to learn more about large scale project management, so that I can hit and then run through a number of pitfalls that will only come from trying to realize such a large aspiration.

Any suggested improvements are more than welcome, feel free to leave issues or submit pull requests!

## Development

Currently, this is a rather simple Cargo project. You should be able to simply clone this repo, then `cd` into the project folder and run `cargo run` to get it going.

## Implemented Features

As of yet, there are no features that are actually implemented in this project. It is still just a Hello World project.
